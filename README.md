#### Working Flow:
In order to create a model these are the following procedure -

  - Split the dataset in 70% of Train set and 30% of Test Set
  - Feature engineering
  - Check the accuracy score for both Training and Test Set
  - Compare the accuracies for both Training and Test set, in order to check for the overfitting issues

#### Overview
●	Achieved 99% accuracy rate in predicting credit card fraud rate by developing logistic regression-based machine learning model.
●	Minimized false positives by 16% through rigorous feature engineering and hyper parameter tuning processes.
●	Implemented under-sampling and ensemble techniques to address class imbalance, leading to 20% improved performance.
●	Successfully mitigated fraudulent transactions while optimizing model efficiency by 25% and accuracy by 8%.

  1. Good Loan Issued: Strong Performance
      -  85.9% of total loans are classified as good loans, demonstrating high-quality lending practices.
      -  33.2K good loan applications resulted in a total funded amount of $370.2M, with $435.8M successfully received.

  2. Bad Loan Issued: Areas of Concern
      -  14.1% of loans are bad loans, indicating some degree of credit risk.
      -  5.3K applications resulted in a funded amount of $65.5M, but only $37.3M has been recovered, leading to potential losses.

#### Details Dashboard

The bank’s loan portfolio is performing well overall, with a high proportion of good loans (85.9%) and strong fund recovery. However, bad loans (14.1%) pose some risks, requiring better risk management, stricter lending policies, and improved loan collection strategies. By optimizing interest rates, DTI ratios, and loan diversification, the bank can further enhance profitability and reduce credit risk.

## Credit Card Fraud Detection

The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

![alt text](https://github.com/Aayush-Basnet/Finance-Domain/blob/502c12f6d208599e0e413e8b8d1e2e6abb5f6d9a/Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20Detection/image.png)

[download Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download)

I employed a Random Forest Classifier for predictive modeling. The model exhibited remarkable accuracy, achieving a score of 99.79%. While this accuracy is promising, it's essential to consider the class imbalance and assess the model's performance using precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure its reliability in real-world fraud detection scenarios.
